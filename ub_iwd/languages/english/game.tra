 @101 = ~Golem Building Book~
 @102 = ~Ah, what an excellent job you did disposing of my simulacrum! It took me a long time to make him, but money is no object when the suffering of others is the greatest reward.  Ha ha ha!~
 
 @301 = ~Well, I'm afraid you'll have to catch me. Good luck.~
 @302 = ~This morning, I woke up and realized that my little ring was a fake. I have no idea who you are, but I feel safe in assuming that *you* are responsible.~
 @303 = ~I should have killed you the first time I saw you. I knew you'd be trouble. Well, you've done it.  My ring is gone, with Ginafae's help, no doubt. Clever girl. You both outsmarted me.~
 @304 = ~Why don't you confront Marketh?~

 @501 = ~Is that a shield made from a rhino beetle? It's a very tough material, and I've read that it takes to enchantments quite well.~

 @503 = ~What's involved with upgrading the shield?~
 @504 = ~Perhaps later.~
 @505 = ~If you change your mind, let me know. Is there anything else I can do for you?~
 @506 = ~It will take a few days to lay in the proper enchantments, and the materials are fairly expensive.~
 @507 = ~Since you brought me this excellent tome on mythals, I'm willing to waive most of the cost. Let's say 15,000 gold.~
 @508 = ~For materials and time, it'll cost 30,000 gold.~
 @509 = ~You have yourself a deal.~
 @510 = ~Excellent. Come back in three days and the shield will be ready. Can I help you with anything else?~
 @511 = ~Welcome back travelers. I have your new shield ready. I laid in several enchantments to make it much tougher.~
 @512 = ~Is there anything else I can do for you?~
 @513 = ~You mentioned upgrading the rhino beetle shield before. What's involved with that?~
