      <p>Like its predecessors for Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, Unfinished      Business for Icewind Dale aims to restore content and quests that   were omitted      from the game as shipped. The additional content in this mod is   based on      what I can piece together from various game resources and from   talking with former developer JE Sawyer on the Obsidian forums. Later, through my work with Beamdog, I was able to secure some of the original quest design notes and further refine the restorations. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Unfinished Business  works with the original Icewind Dale (with or   without the expansions Heart of Winter      and Trials of the   Luremaster) or the IWD-in-BG2 project. Two components (<em>Marketh's Ring</em> and <em>Actual Shadows in Vale of Shadows</em>) are   available for IWDEE. This mod makes   interactive changes and therefore      should be compatible with other   mods. For normal Icewind Dale, the mod was tested with the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/iwd_fixpack/">Icewind Dale      Fixpack</a> installed (highly recommended), though I do not anticipate      problems if the Fixpack is not installed. </p>
      <p> The <em>Marketh's Ring</em> and <em>Actual Shadows in Vale of Shadows</em> components are available for Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. The rest of the restorations were included in IWDEE itself. </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/24870-iwd-mod-install-order-thread/">good rundown of install order and incompatibilities</a> for several common Icewind Dale mods is available on the forums. </p>
      <p>Auril's Bane also restores the  Voice of Durdel Anatha quest; if Unfinished      Business is installed after Auril's Bane then <acronym title="Unfinished Business">UB</acronym>'s      version of this quest will replace AB's version. In terms of      install order, <acronym title="Unfinished Business">UB</acronym> should      follow Auril's Bane. </p>
      <p>Since most of these restorations involve changes to area files   (which are      stored in the save games), they are not available to   games in progress if      you've visited the quest areas already. </p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please     note   that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If   in   the   middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch     update (if   possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might     not be able   to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively,   copy   the whole   game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and   will   stay   untouched by game patches. It is important that you     install   the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in.       Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error       messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Unfinished Business for Icewind Dale  for Windows is   distributed as a     self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU   installer. To install,     simply double-click   the archive and follow   the instructions on   screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-ub_iwd.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>ub_iwd</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-ub_iwd.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-ub_iwd.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Unfinished Business for Icewind Dale for macOS is   distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-ub_iwd</strong>, <strong>setup-ub_iwd.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>ub_iwd</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-ub_iwd.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-ub_iwd.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Unfinished Business for Icewind Dale for Linux is   distributed as a   compressed   tarball and does not   include a WeiDU   installer.  Linux   users will need   to do a one-time   install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall ub_iwd in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual       components, you can completely uninstall the mod using       setup-ub_iwd --uninstall at the command line to remove all       components without wading through prompts. </p>

      <h2>Contents</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>There are ten components, all of which can be installed   independently of      one another. I've tried to be a bit vague with the   actual content so as not      to spoil the restored content; you can   always ask for spoilers or additional      information on the mod's <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forum/152-icewind-dale-mod-roundup/">discussion      forum</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>The Voice of Durdel Anatha</strong></p>
      <p> This is probably the best known of the missing content, and a   slightly      different version is available as part of the core content   of Auril's Bane.      This component restores the Voice of Durdel   Anatha, a cursed paladin of Torm      forced to wander around Lower   Dorn's Deep. The party can free him of his      curse.</p>
      <p><strong>Malavon's Golems</strong></p>
      <p> There was a book that detailed how Malavon created his twin iron        golems. The party can possibly deactivate or even turn them   against      Malavon. </p>
      <p><strong>Marketh's Ring</strong><br />
        <em>Available for IWDEE</em></p>
      <p> The trickiest restoration, Marketh originally had a ring that   allowed      him to teleport around Lower Dorn's Deep, making him   impossible to catch.      This idea was eventually abandoned for a   different path altogether. I've      tried to restore this quest while   keeping many aspects of the Marketh-Ginafae-Malavon      relationship as   possible, while still restoring the original quest to deal      with   Marketh's ring. </p>
      <p><strong>Expanded Guello/Beorn Quest</strong></p>
      <p> When you speak with the deep gnomes, they actually ask for two   things--that      you kill Shikata and his salamander kin (thus freeing   Guello) and also      to stop the umber hulks that are digging and   searching for their hidden      enclave. Guello will now reward you for   both tasks instead of just one      of them. Note that this also   restores a wave of umber hulks in Tarnelm's      oubliette, making the   battle here a bit tougher. </p>
      <p><strong>Presio's Duel</strong></p>
      <p> The third level of Dragon's Eye features Presio and her legions   of undead.      As the party travels the area, she speaks to the party   via her undead lieutenants.      Paladins and mages can call her out to   single combat through one of these      vessels. </p>
      <p><strong>Orrick's Rhino Beetle Shield</strong> </p>
      <p> The duergar Dirty Llew can fashion a shield out of rhino beetle   shells for      the party; Nym can further enchant the shield. As an   alternative, the party      can take Llew's shield to Orrick in Kuldahar   instead with a slightly different      result. </p>
      <p><strong>The High Baptist's Flock</strong> </p>
      <p> Some leftover dialogues and scripting suggested The High Baptist   was   supposed  to have some followers. When you encounter him on the   fifth   level of the  Dragon's Eye, he'll now have a small but &quot;loyal&quot;     congregation.</p>
      <p><strong>Actual Shadows in Vale of Shadows [Graion Dilach] </strong><br />
        <em>Available for IWDEE</em></p>
      <p> The Vale of Shadows area files define the Lesser Shadows in the area to constantly respawn untiill Lysan's demise, but due to a definition error, this behavior only works for one spawning slot. Because this would heavily affect early-game balance, it wasn't restored in IWDEE and the component is available for that game as well. </p>
      <p><strong>Minor Item Restorations</strong></p>
      <p> A handful of minor items were found in the game files that are   not   actually available in the game. To minimize influence on game   balance   these items have primarily been added to stores. New items are   the  Belt   of Stones, Briath's Journal, Elven Sewn Boots, Elven Sewn Cloak, Elven Sewn Gloves, Gauntlet of Valor, Great   Halberd +4, Holy   Chaos! Deck, Illian's Hunting Helm, Inferno Darts +4, Potion of Clear   Purpose, Potion of   Greater Resistance, Potion of Resistance, Silver   Bracers of Kedl, and   The Dire Old Lute of Pellon Kay. High quality   arrows, bolts, short bows,   light crossbows, and heavy crossbows have   also been restored as random   drops.</p>
      <p><strong>Restored Random Drops</strong><br />
        <em>Requires Heart of Winter</em></p>
      <p> The Heart of Winter expansion alters the random drop table to     account for new  items scattered throughout the game. In the process     several items were removed  outright, making them no longer available in     the game. This component does not  alter items that were simply moved     around the table (i.e. Bren Muller's  Crossbow) but it does restore     several items to the random drop table:</p>
      <p>Bastard Sword +3: Incinerator, Bhaal's Fire, Demon's Breath,   Foe's   Fate, Greater Ring of the Warrior, Large Shield of Strength +1,   Long Bow   +4: Hammer, Long Sword of Action +4, Morning Star +2: Hammer,   Morning   Star of Action +4, Potion of Arcane Absorption, Potion of   Aura   Enhancement, Potion of Constitution, Potion of Dissipation,   Reinforced   Large Shield +2, Ring of Aura Transfusion, Ring of Greater   Resistance,   Ring of Reckless Action, Ring of the Warrior Thief,   Shocking Flail +4,   Short Sword +4: Hammer, Sloth, Spiked Long Sword   +1, Static Two Handed   Sword +4, Studded Leather +2: Shadowed, Studded   Leather +4: Shadowed,   Studded Leather of Resistance +3, Two Handed Axe   of Resistance +3, Two   Handed Sword +1: Hammering, Two Handed Sword   +3: Bane, Two Handed Sword   +4: Backbiter, Two Handed Sword +4: Life   Giver, Two Handed Sword of   Resistance +1, War Hammer +4: Defender, War   Hammer of Phasing +2 (2H),   and the War Hammer of Phasing +3.</p>

      <p>First, a big thanks to the wonderful community at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">The      Gibberlings Three</a>. Thanks to the still active and vibrant Infinity      Engine modding community. </p>
      <p>I'd  like to give a big thank you to Razfallow, who was    working      on a (stalled) mod that including some of these ideas and   let me do it instead.      Thanks also to Kulyok and redrake for   bringing some of the content to my      attention. Thanks to Graion Dilach for spotting and restoring the <em>Actual Shadows in Vale of Shadows</em> component.</p>
      <p>Thanks for JE Sawyer, one of the <acronym title="Icewind Dale">IWD</acronym> developers, for guidance on restoring some of the cut content, particularly in the restoration of the Voice of Durdel Anatha. </p>
      <p>The IWD-in-BG2 compatibility code for the random treasure tables was shamelessly borrowed from DavidW.</p>

      <p><strong>Version 11 - September 28, 2022</strong></p>
      <ul>

        <li>Updated a lot of code behind the scenes; name updating the translation scheme to be a little more modern as well as making the mod more portable</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 9 - December 1, 2021</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Made a minor adjustment to <em>The High Baptist's Flock</em> component to account for changes made in IWD Fixpack v7</li>
        <li>Added four more items to <em>Minor Item Restorations</em>: Elven Sewn Boots, Elven Sewn Cloak, Elven Sewn Gloves, and Illian's Hunting Helm</li>
        <li>Added a Brazilian Portuguese translation, courtesy of  Felipe</li>
        <li>Added Project Infinity compatibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 8 - September 8, 2018</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marketh's Ring, the lone restoration omitted from the Enhanced Edition, is now available for IWDEE and the EET conversion</li>
        <li>Backported some fixes from IWDEE:
          <ul>
            <li>For the Voice quest, Brother Harken will now spawn at the door regardless of which entrance you use to reach area with the evil idol. This will help prevent players from prematurely ending the quest by destroying the idol before confronting Harken and the Voice.</li>
            <li>If you win the duel with Presio, the stringhead with the victory message no longer assumes Player1, since it could be any party member who enters the duel.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Purged some redundant code and macros </li>
      </ul>

        <li>Expanded the <em>Minor Item Restorations</em> component with some unused high quality items, a few more random drops, and the Potion of Clear Purpose</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with <em>The Voice of Durdel Anatha</em> component   with the Artisan's District. The umber hulk trap that   reveals the Pale   Justice sword should wait until the Voice has been   laid to rest, but was   instead not opening at all if you had previously   visited.</li>
        <li>Revisited the treachery detection for<em> Presio's Duel</em> to make it more robust</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug with The Glory of Suffering armor, one of the quest rewards for <em>The Voice of Durdel Anatha</em> (thanks to       Minttunator on the forums) </li>
        <li>Added German translation (thanks Mike!)</li>
        <li>Updated the French translation (thanks Anomaly!) and the Russian translation (thanks prowler!)</li>

        <li>Added the <em>Minor Item Restorations</em> component</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where <em>Presio's Duel</em> would fail to install on HoW/TotL games if Auril's Bane is installed</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 5 - February 14, 2011</strong></p>
      <ul>

        <li>Fixed bug preventing install if <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> can't find ini files for the<em> Presio's Duel</em> and <em>Expanded Guello/Beorn Quest </em>components</li>
        <li>The option to deactivate or turn Malavon's iron golems is more prominent by way of availability on more branches of dialogue</li>
        <li>The time for Norl to make a copy of Marketh's ring has been substantially reduced</li>
        <li>Closed a bug where you could reset the variable controlling the <em>Marketh's Ring</em> quest midway through, making it impossible to finish, by following a     very specific dialogue path with Ginafae if the ring was in progress</li>
        <li>Removed a duplicate line from Ginafae and gave the player better reply options while Norl is making the copy</li>
        <li><em>Presio's Duel</em> could be broken a number of ways due   to   some loose triggers. These have been tightened up and better   detection   for treachery (i.e. agreeing to single combat and then   sending multiple   characters) to make this work as expected</li>
        <li>Now works with the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/155-icewind-dale-in-baldurs-gate-ii/" title="Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II">Icewind Dale in Baldur's Gate II</a> mod</li>
